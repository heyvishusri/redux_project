# Redux Toolkit + Vite Counter (Beginner Project)

A simple counter app built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Redux Toolkit**. Demonstrates modern state management patterns and scalable project structure.

---

##  Features

- Increment, decrement, reset, and add customizable amount to the counter.
- Built using modern Redux Toolkit (`configureStore`, `createSlice`).
- Clean, modular folder structure for scalable coding.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.19+ or v22.12+) recommended.
- Basic knowledge of React, Redux, and JavaScript.

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Scaffold project using Vite
npm create vite@latest rtk-beginner -- --template react
cd rtk-beginner

# Install Redux Toolkit & React-Redux
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

# Start the development server
npm run dev
````

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view the app.

## Project Breakdown

1. **Store Setup** (`src/app/store.js`): Configured using `configureStore` for easy setup and built-in DevTools support.
2. **State Slice** (`src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`): Uses `createSlice` to define actions (`increment`, `decrement`, `reset`, `incrementByAmount`) and reducer logic—simplifying code with Immer-powered immutability.
3. **UI Component** (`src/features/counter/Counter.jsx`): Uses `useSelector` to access state, `useDispatch` to trigger actions, and allows adding custom amounts through local component state.
4. **App Integration** (`src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`): Wraps the application in `<Provider>` to connect React with the Redux store and renders the Counter component.

## Core Concepts & Interview Insights

* **Redux Toolkit Advantages**: It simplifies store setup, reduces boilerplate with `createSlice`, automatically adds default middleware like thunk, and integrates DevTools out of the box. ([redux-toolkit.js.org][1])
* **Redux Principles**: Single source of truth, immutable state updates, pure reducers, and unidirectional data flow.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Modular “feature-first” folder structure keeps logic and UI components organized and easy to extend.
* **Typical Flow**: User interacts → component dispatches action → slice updates state → UI re-renders via `useSelector`.

## Interview Q\&A (Sample)

Below you’ll find key questions you might face in a placement interview, along with succinct, effective answers you can reference.

| **Question**                                            | **Answer**                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Why use Redux Toolkit over plain Redux?**             | Redux Toolkit simplifies setup (`configureStore`), reduces boilerplate via `createSlice`, and includes DevTools and thunk automatically. ([redux-toolkit.js.org][1]) |
| **Describe your folder structure and why it's useful.** | Follows a feature-based structure with `app/` for store and `features/` for domain slices—this keeps code maintainable and scalable.                                 |
| **What does `configureStore` do?**                      | It wraps store creation with sensible defaults: combines reducers, adds middleware (like thunk), and enables DevTools. ([redux-toolkit.js.org][1])                   |
| **Explain `createSlice`.**                              | `createSlice` lets you define action creators and reducers in one place, using Immer to allow mutation-like syntax. ([redux-toolkit.js.org][1])                      |
| **How do your components interact with the store?**     | Components use `useSelector` to read state and `useDispatch` to send actions. React-Redux updates the UI when state changes.                                         |
| **How would you handle async operations?**              | With `createAsyncThunk` for side-effects or RTK Query for fetching and caching—both are built into Redux Toolkit. ([redux-toolkit.js.org][1], [Telerik.com][2])      |
| **How can this setup scale for larger apps?**           | Additional feature slices can be easily added. Async logic, normalization, and APIs (via RTK Query) can be integrated for real-world needs. ([Telerik.com][2])       |
| **How does Redux improve state reliability?**           | Centralized state and immutable updates ensure predictable behavior, easier debugging, and simpler scaling.                                                          |

## Final Summary

This project demonstrates your ability to architect a React + Redux application using modern toolkits and best practices. It’s both compact and expressive—great for interviews. You’ve shown:

* Clean, modular folder structure
* Proficiency with Redux Toolkit (store, slice, logic)
* Understanding of data flow and React-Redux hooks
* Readiness to handle async logic and scale up to larger apps
