##  Features

- Increment, decrement, reset the counter
- Add a custom amount to the counter
- Built using modern Redux Toolkit (`configureStore`, `createSlice`)
- Scalable and clean feature-based folder structure

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.19+ or v22.12+ recommended)
- Familiarity with React and JavaScript basics

### Installation & Development

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/heyvishusri/redux_project.git
cd redux_project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev
````

Open the local server URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) shown in the terminal to view the app in action.

## Project Breakdown

* **`src/app/store.js`**: Configures the Redux store using `configureStore`—includes DevTools and middleware by default.
* **`src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`**: Defines the counter state slice with `createSlice`, auto-generating actions (`increment`, `decrement`, `reset`, `incrementByAmount`) and reducer logic.
* **`src/features/counter/Counter.jsx`**: UI component that reads from state via `useSelector`, dispatches actions via `useDispatch`, and supports custom input for amount-add.
* **`src/main.jsx`** & **`src/App.jsx`**: Wraps the app in `<Provider>` to connect Redux and renders the `Counter` component inside.

## Interview Q\&A (Sample)

Below are common interview questions with concise, effective answers around this project’s setup:

| **Question**                                              | **Answer**                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Why use Redux Toolkit over plain Redux?**            | RTK simplifies store setup with `configureStore`, reduces boilerplate through `createSlice`, and includes middleware (like thunk) and DevTools out-of-the-box. |
| **2. What’s the folder structure and why is it helpful?** | Follows a feature-first approach (`app/`, `features/`), making code modular, maintainable, and easy to scale.                                                  |
| **3. What does `configureStore` do?**                     | Combines reducers, adds middleware, and enables Redux DevTools with minimal configuration.                                                                     |
| **4. Explain `createSlice`.**                             | A combined way to define action creators and reducers; allows immutability using Immer while keeping code concise.                                             |
| **5. How do components interact with the store?**         | Components use `useSelector` to read state and `useDispatch` to send actions. Changes trigger re-renders accordingly.                                          |
| **6. How would you handle async logic or API calls?**     | Use `createAsyncThunk` for actions with side-effects, or RTK Query for data fetching and caching.                                                              |
| **7. How does Redux improve reliability?**                | Centralized state, immutable updates, predictable behavior, and DevTools support make debugging and scaling simpler.                                           |
| **8. How can this project setup scale for larger apps?**  | You can add more slices under `features/`, integrate async middlewares or RTK Query, normalize state, etc.—all in a modular fashion.                           |
